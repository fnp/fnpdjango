    When a user asks for a place available for saving a file and
    the proposed filename is occupied, default Django file storage
    looks for a free spot by appending a suffix.

    This storage just deletes the previous content and replies:
    sure, just save it right where you want it.

    The user is now responsible for making sure they don't
    accidentally overwrite anything they weren't supposed to,
    and for sane caching settings.
